Diary of a Ravenclaw is a repository to share resources about my experiences as Engineer in Computer Engineering. Here I will post fundamentals, programming, computing, maths, architecture, programming competitive, and more. You can contribute to improve my studying, correcting sentenses, exercises and solving issues (probable questions that I have).

# Getting started

This is the main page, here you can find the link to go to other pages and contents that you have interesting.

If you want to contribute feel free to up some corrections about my resources. Probably in the future I will add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` to help who want contribute.

# Table of Contents

Here you can access my contents easy filtering by subject type.
