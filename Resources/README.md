# Resoureces

## What is it ?

Resources are a place to save archives of others repositores from github, projects that could help in programming. Here is a local to backup these files.

## Credits

All the credits is in the files, I do not remove the credits if it have it.

But to secure that have the credits, follow the list of the references:

| File                                 | Credits                                                                                    |
