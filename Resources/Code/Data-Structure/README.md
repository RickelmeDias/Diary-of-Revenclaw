In this page I will write about Data Structure, what is, how measure it, how construct it, the type of data structures and more.

## Data Structure

Data structures are ways to store data with algorithms that support operations on the data. Each data structure algorithm has it is strengths and weaknesses. As software engineers is necessary to know the complexity of algorithms, to choose the best data structure to solve a determined problem.

Now make sense the motivation about study the algorithm complexity, with the Computational Complexity explanation is possible define if the determined algorithm is better than other for a problem. When complexity makes sense, we can use it to test whether our algorithms are implemented correctly or not. [Clicking here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47GRtdHOKMg) you can watch a short video about Computational Complexity, and you can watch a [complete video about it clicking here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo4vesaut8g).

Considering that you know why an algorithm is a computational procedure that can take some value(s) as input and procedure some value(s) as output, we can start to talk about the algorithms complexity, however if you have no idea about algorithms [I suggest you read this topic](https://algoparc.ics.hawaii.edu/~nodari/teaching/f15/Notes/Topic-01.html) by University of Hawaii.

##### Easy definition for Data Strucutre

- Ways to store data inside memory and execute operations;
- Manage datas efficiently.

### Algorithm Complexity

When the software implementation will be started, is necessary to define what data structures should be used, because some data structures could be more efficient than others.

To know the complexity is important to choose the most efficient algorithm, considering this is necessary to analyze two things: _time_ and _space_. **What algorithm use more time to be executed, and what algorithm use more space to execute?**

This is the main question for the Algorithm Complexity study, to explain the importance of this subject see this example below:

If you have a computer like this on the image below, you probably won't have problems with the space and processing, rigth? Maybe, for the simple and fundamental algorithms that we will see here yes, you won't have problems, but for Quantum Algorithms like Shor's Algorithm, this modern computer will have problems.

Considering that this modern computer can run our simple and fundamental algorithms, okay we won't have problems.

Now let's think of a tiny component like a microcontroller, it has short memory and storage, depending on the chosen algorithms the efficiency of the work performed by the microcontroller may have problems, thus leaving it less efficient than expected.

With this introduction, what is better? More space? Less time? Less space? More Time? _Really depends..._

#### Complexity Analisis

To analyze running time and space of algorithm we will use a the Asymptotic Analysis, it will help to calculate the time and space complexity. If you like the topics and articles that I suggest [you can read this document about analysis by MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/1-204-computer-algorithms-in-systems-engineering-spring-2010/8ee75d49f1cb9a947f1d3f15a2aa9e00_MIT1_204S10_lec05.pdf).
